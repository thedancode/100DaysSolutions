#This is a generalization of Exercise 1.
#Whereas the original exercise only wanted the program to produce the sum of any two-digit number, this solution produces the sum for a number of any length.

number = input("Enter a number of any length ")

sum = 0

# Below, we use "for" to go through each digit in the "number" string
# We use int(x) to convert each digit that the "for" loop goes through into an integer
# We will be using a recursion with initial value sum = 0
# If you want to see the running total per iteration over the for loop, insert "print(sum)", indented, at line 15.

for x in number:
  sum += int(x)


print(sum)
