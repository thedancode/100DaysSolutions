# Since the instructions weren't clear on the extent to which the computer/dealer draws cards for theirself and
# I did not want to look at Angela's code/solution to clarify this aspect of the challenge before trying it on my own,
# I made it so that the dealer stops drawing cards if its hand is less than 17.
# I attempted the "Expert" difficulty for this project - the only hint being how Blackjack works.

############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.
